## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[(https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html)]
[(https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    
    *The first challenge I overcame was color choices, trying to decide which color scheme worked best was a pain.  I wanted to have a dark background mixed with a lighter font color, but I didn’t want to go with a standard black and white.  I used google and found a deep navy and orangeish color that I went with.  Second challenge was font style, I wasn’t a fan of the sans-serif so I went to w3 to find different font styles to use.  Third challenge was the button sizing for my start button, along with shape.  I hated the blocky style plus the size didn’t seem give a very clean look to the program.  I googled and found the w3schools css button styling portion.  I played with the sizes and padding till I felt it gave a cleaner look to match by button size and shape.  I also used this website to overcome my fourth challenge which was color, size, and shape of the buttons.  My fifth challenge was choosing the button clicked change, I opted to add words and a color border instead of just a hue shift, so that people that were color impaired could still participate in my game.  Sixth challenge which was also a realization, was that the overall style choices for the #gamebutton would override my specific choices for each individual button, took a little tinkering, then I removed it and added color to each button specifically.  My seventh challenge was getting an understanding of css syntax.  I had an issue where my buttons wouldn’t register as clicked when the computer was playing the pattern.  After trying a few fixes, I figured out that I had missed a comma!*

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    
    *After completing this project my first question would be, how exactly do developers select color schemes and sizes of buttons or headings?  Things like backgrounds and transitions of buttons or pages?  That in itself seems like the biggest worry to me.  Personally, I tend to like clean layouts with uniformity, but I know that’s not everyone. So I am curious about how all those decisions are figured out.  Also I am curious about coding style on group projects?  Are other developers allowed to come an adjust your logic if they feel theirs makes more sense?  Another question I have would be time frames, who decides how long each portion of development should take and how is that calculated?*

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    
    *If I had more time to work on the project, I would have liked to complete the rest of the optional features.  I would have liked to add the button playback speed increase, I feel like this adds more realism and competitiveness to the game.  I would like to add an easy and hard feature, this would allow you to adjust play back speed or how many wrong answers you are allowed.  Another feature that I think would be awesome to add, is to change the tone of all the buttons and have the pattern mimic a song using those tones.  That can also be turned into a trivia style game where user would be able to guess the song of the pattern or continue playing the tune*
